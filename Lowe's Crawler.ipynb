    "# Extracting All Webpages\n",
    "\n",
    "This script automates the process of navigating to specific URLs and extracting HTML content using Python's Selenium library. The script accesses a series of web pages from a base URL with varying offsets, captures their HTML source, and saves it to local files.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## How the Script Works\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Base URL**: `https://www.lowes.com/pl/fall-decorations/fall-wreaths-garland/1614047588`\n",
    "- **Offsets**: Created to generate pages at intervals of 24, ranging from 0 to 144.\n",
    "- An array `urls` is constructed by appending each offset to the base URL.\n",
    "- For each URL in the `urls` list, the script configures a headless Chrome browser.\n",
    "- The `user-agent` is set to mimic a desktop browser to prevent being identified as a bot.\n",
    "- The script waits explicitly for the body tag of the page to ensure the page is fully loaded.\n",
    "- After an additional delay of 10 seconds, the HTML of the page is captured.\n",
    "- This HTML content is then written to a sequentially numbered file.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output\n",
    "- The script logs the completion of each page's processing to the console.\n",
    "- HTML files are saved in the format `html_pages/page_{n}.html`, where `{n}` is the page number starting from 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Potential Improvements\n",
    "- WebDriver should crawl all links in one session, instead of crawling each page separately in separate sessions\n",
    "- WebDriver should be able to click next page button to navigate to next web page, instead of using offsets in URL\n",
    "- For faster crawling, should be able to use scrapy with playwright instead of selenium\n",
    "- Handling exceptions to manage errors during web navigation.\n",
    "- Using session and cookies to maintain login states if needed.\n",
    "- Implementing a more robust waiting mechanism instead of a fixed sleep interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Usage\n",
    "- Selenium and ChromeWebdriver is installed\n",
    "- ensure there exists a folder with name \"html_pages\", in the same directory as this jupyter file.\n",
    "- The script can be executed within a Python environment where Selenium is installed, and it will handle the crawling automatically.\n"
